# Python Calculator
## Introduction
I think most people write a calculator program as one of their first projects when starting to code - I was no different! 

My first attempt at this challenge was in 2019 with the file *CalculatorFile.py*. Looks back on it now, nearly 3 years later, it was amazing to see how - frankly awful - my code was which gave me a nice bit of motivation to revisit it with my skills learnt over the years. 

*calculator.py* combines lots of my skills learnt over the past few years and helps to show we're always learning - I'm certain this repo will be revisted in the future and I'll give it another go. 

## Future Steps
* Revisit in the future!
* Testing...
